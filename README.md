# danone-esg-case-study
This project models the cradle-to-retail carbon footprint of a selected Danone product SKU (Yogurt, France, 2020 baseline), and identifies actionable levers to reduce emissions while aligning with ESG targets. The analysis applies **GHG Protocol Scope 1/2/3 accounting**, AGRIBALYSE LCIs, and scenario-based abatement cost modeling.
